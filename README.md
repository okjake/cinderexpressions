#cinderExpressions

A facial expression classifier, based on Kyle McDonald and Jason Saragih's [FaceOSC](https://raw.github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/master/readme.md), [Cinder](http://libcinder.org), and [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info).

Pull a face, name it, save it. Then recognise it.

You'll need to do the following to build this:

- Checkout this project and put it into your Cinder apps folder
- Download [FaceOSCSyphon](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/downloads) and put it in the resources folder. Make sure it's added to the resources group in your XCode project.
- You need the [Cinder-Syphon](https://github.com/astellato/Cinder-Syphon), [ciUI](https://github.com/rezaali/ciUI), and osc Cinder blocks.
